History

28/4/2025
First draft. Inspiration from a mock idea for a 2D Slime Rancher-inspired game and WebFishing on Steam. Also some actions/movement inspired by videos of Shovel Knight.

1/5/2025
Basic actions, logic, and home screen tiled. More flushed out storyboard/gameplay ideas. Very much so inspired by WebFishing's level up system but takes aspects of Slime Rancher's corral system too. Taking a break to participate in [Mini Jame Gam #42 hosted by tiimo, AmiableVegetable, AcidBurritos on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-42).
